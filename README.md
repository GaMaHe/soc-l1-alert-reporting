# SOC Level 1 – Alert Reporting

This repository documents hands-on experience simulating the role of a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 Analyst**, focused on alert triage, analysis, documentation, and initial incident response using a simulated SIEM dashboard.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical SOC L1 workflows, analytical thinking, and structured incident reporting rather than tool-specific expertise.

---

## 🔍 Scope of the Project

This project simulates real-world SOC Level 1 responsibilities, including:

- Monitoring and reviewing security alerts from a SIEM-like dashboard  
- Performing alert triage and prioritization  
- Investigating suspicious activity using available evidence  
- Identifying false positives vs. potential security incidents  
- Documenting findings in a clear and structured manner  
- Making escalation decisions based on defined criteria  

All analysis is performed in a **controlled, simulated environment** designed for defensive security training.

## 🧠 SOC Level 1 Responsibilities Modeled

- Alert classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Initial investigation and evidence review
- IOC identification and contextual analysis
- Incident documentation and closure
- Escalation recommendation to SOC Level 2 when applicable

## 📂 Repository Structure


### 📁 cases/
Each case folder represents a single alert or incident ticket and includes:
- `analysis.md` – alert investigation and reasoning
- `evidence/` – screenshots or supporting artifacts
- `conclusion.md` – final classification and decision

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- Simulated SIEM alert dashboard
- Alert metadata and visual indicators
- Manual alert triage, analysis, and documentation following SOC L1 workflows

> Note: The focus of this project is **process, analysis, and reporting**, not automation or tool engineering.

## 📌 Methodology

The investigation process followed for each alert:

1. Review alert details and severity  
2. Analyze available context and indicators  
3. Assess likelihood of malicious activity and potential impact 
4. Classify the alert (false positive / suspicious / incident)  
5. Document findings and reasoning  
6. Decide whether escalation is required  

Detailed methodology is documented in the `docs/` directory.
